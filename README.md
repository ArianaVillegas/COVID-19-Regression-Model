# COVID-19 Regression Model

COVID-19 is a new pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it spreads rapidly from person to person. This pandemic is the most notable global crisis since World War II. According to literature, the outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has triggered a global economic crisis whose impact will be felt in the coming years [1]. Consequently, there is a need to verify the impact of this virus on our society.

The purpose of this project is to implement a regression model that fits the data of COVID-19 in Peru. The model will analyze the data to identify patterns and trends, which can help us understand the impact of COVID-19 on Peru's society and economy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains daily data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in Peru. The data is sourced from the Peruvian Ministry of Health and spans from March 6th, 2020 to the present day. The data will be preprocessed and cleaned before it is used to train and test the regression model.

## Regression Model

The regression model used in this project will be implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library. The model will be trained using the preprocessed data and will be used to make predictions on future COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in Peru.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the data using a regression model, we can gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on Peru's society and economy. This project aims to provide a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers to understand the trends and patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru.
